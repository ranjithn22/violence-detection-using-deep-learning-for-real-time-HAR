# violence-detection-using-deep-learning-for-real-time-HAR
This repository contains the implementation of "Video Surveillance System Using Deep Learning for Real-Time Human Action Recognition (HAR)". The system is designed for real-time violence detection using deep learning techniques, integrating YOLO for object detection and GRU for temporal sequence modeling.
